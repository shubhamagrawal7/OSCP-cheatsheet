# Brute-forcing Techniques

Brute-forcing is a technique used in penetration testing or hacking to gain unauthorized access to a system or accounts by systematically trying different combinations of passwords or other credentials. Here are some common bruteforcing techniques:

## Service Bruteforcing

Service bruteforcing involves attempting to gain access to a specific service by trying different combinations of usernames and passwords. It can be used to target services such as SSH, FTP, Telnet, etc.

Example:
* `hydra -l <usernames_file> -P <passwords_file> <target_ip> <service>`
  - `-l <username>`: Specifies the username to Bruteforce
  - `-L <username_file>`: Specifies the list of username to bruteforce. Replace `username_file` with the path to the list.
  - `-P <password_file>`: Specifies the list of password to bruteforce. Most common password list is `rockyou.txt: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
  - `<target_ip>`: Give the target IP you want to bruteforce.
  - `<service>`: Service could be ftp, smb, snmp etc.

## Bruteforce login password

Bruteforcing is a technique used to crack passwords by guessing multiple combinations of characters until the correct password is found. This technique can be used to gain unauthorized access to a web application by guessing the login password.

**Example: To conduct a bruteforce attack, use a tool such as Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder.**

**For example, to bruteforce the login page of a web application, use the following command with Hydra: `hydra -l username -P /path/to/passwords.txt example.com http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid username or password"`.**

This command will use the username `username` and passwords from the file `/path/to/passwords.txt` to bruteforce the login page at `example.com/login.php`.

## Wpscan Password Bruteforcing

```
wpscan --url <target URL> --username <username> --passwords <passwords file>
```

* `--url <target URL>`: Specifies the target URL of the WordPress site
* `--username <username>`: Specifies the username to target.
* `--passwords <passwords file>`: Specifies the file containing the list of passwords to be used in the brute-force attack
