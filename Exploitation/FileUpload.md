# File Upload Techniques and Bypassing Restrictions

File upload functionality in web applications can be an avenue for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
Before uploading a file for malicious purposes like reverse shell, you need a [reverse shell]().
Here are some file upload techniques and ways to bypass file upload restrictions:

## File Upload Techniques

### 1. Direct File Upload

- Use the web application's file upload functionality to upload files directly.
- Typically, a file selection input field is provided on the web page for choosing the file to upload.
- Example: Upload a file by selecting it from the file upload input field on the web page.

### 2. MIME Type Spoofing

- Modify the MIME type (content type) of the file to bypass restrictions.
- Web applications may check the file's MIME type to ensure it matches the allowed types.
- Example: Change the MIME type of an executable file to `image/jpeg` and attempt the upload.

## Bypassing File Upload Restrictions

### 1. Double Extensions

- Append a valid file extension to the end of a malicious file with an invalid extension.
- By adding a valid extension, you may trick the application into thinking it is an allowed file type.
- Example: Change the malicious file from `malicious.php` to `malicious.php.jpg` and attempt the upload.

### 2. Null Byte Injection

- Add a null byte character (%00) at the end of the file name to bypass file type checks.
- Some applications may use the file name for validation, and appending a null byte can deceive the system.
- Example: Change the malicious file from `malicious.php` to `malicious.php%00.jpg` and attempt the upload.

### 3. File Signature Manipulation

- Modify the file signature (magic bytes) to disguise the file type and bypass validation checks.
- By changing the file signature, you can trick the system into treating the file as a different type.
- Example: Change the file signature of a malicious file to match the signature of an allowed file type and attempt the upload.
- List of file signatures can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
